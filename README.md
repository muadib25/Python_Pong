# Python_Pong
A simple Pong game I did on python, during a Coursera Interactive Python course via Rice University. 
The game runs at the moment via the Codeskulptor.org page, although there are plans to use a Python Library like PyGame or 
similar in the future. We'll see...

To view the code in action and/or play the game just go to www.codeskulptor.org and paste the code on the left window,
followed by clicking on the 'Play' button located on the panel's top-left side.

Or you can just visit this page for the 1-player game:

and this page for the 2-player game:

Have fun!
