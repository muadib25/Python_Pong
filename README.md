# Python_Pong
A simple Pong game I did on python, during a Coursera Interactive Python course via Rice University. 
The game runs at the moment via the Codeskulptor.org page, by pasting it on the left window and clicking on the 'Play' button 
located on the top-left side.
Or you can just visit this page for the 1-player game: http://www.codeskulptor.org/#user43_y6xOM4hJoG_3.py

and this page for the 2-player game: http://www.codeskulptor.org/#user43_Ezs2swGIxK_3.py

Have fun!
